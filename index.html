                      Decoupled web apps really interesting me. Currently in my spare time I'm working of a decoupled version of my portfolio website.
                      Using VueJS for the Front End, and Drupal 8 + JSON API Module for the back end.

                    <p>
                      My first taste of JS frameworks was starting with AngularJS 1. I followed a tutorial on building with AngularJS including handling routes and resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This lead to building a Weather Forecast WebApp. In the app the user can input the city, which they would like forecast for and also select the forecast duration. Upon sumbitting a call is made to the API for openweathermap.org, which then returns the results.

                    <p>
                      I have been working with Drupal for a while now I pretty much dived into the CMS when I started development. But never really begun with a basic understanding of how Content Management Systems works in the background. So I started to build a simple CMS from the beginning using <a href="https://css-tricks.com/php-for-beginners-building-your-first-simple-cms/" target="_blank">https://css-tricks.com/php-for-beginners-building-your-first-simple-cms/</a> as a starting place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      From there I started to improve upon this by restructuring how it worked. I created classes and then extended those classes for object-oriented programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I also begun going through the code and updating MySql functions set by the tutorial to MySqli.

                    <p>
                      One example is a custom module used to make an API calls providing 360 gallery view of used cars. This module was written by another developer to make a PHP Curl to the API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, over time I have had to learn how this works and update this module needed updateing, the API call changing or additional features needed adding.

                    <p>Custom features were added to the sites to enhance the UX, which was achieved with a mixture of jQuery, SASS and PHP.</p>
