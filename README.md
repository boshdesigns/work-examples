##### Simple CMS
I have been working with Drupal for a while now I pretty much dived into the CMS when I started development. But never really begin with a basic understand of who CMS work in the background.
So I started to build a simple CMS from the beginning use https://css-tricks.com/php-for-beginners-building-your-first-simple-cms/ as a starting place.

## Work Place Websites

A few examples of the most recent sites I have worked on in my current workplace:

### CSMC
<a href="www.csmc.co.uk" target="_blank">View Chipping of Sodbury</a>

Being a franchise dealer, each franchise needed it's own site and each with their own guideline standard to comply too. Which meant this was a build that consisted of 4 separate sites including a group site.

Custom features were added to the sites to enhance the UX, which was achieved with a mixture of jQuery, SASS and PHP.

Through the build challenges presented themselves, for example how certain elements were laid out in the design compared to how these would display within responsive design. But these issues were overcome successfully by liaising with designs.

### Foreman Ford
<a href="foremanford.co.uk" target="_blank">View Foreman Ford</a>

Whilst this site had its challenges in the form of manufacturer guidelines it did allow me to flecks my creative muscles. As per the design brief, hover effects were requested to be added to the homepage call to actions. This allowed me to put into practice my CSS3 knowledge to create an effect with elements overlaying and moving with different timings. This made for an eye catching effect giving more depth to what could have been a fairly standard call to action.

### Norton Way

Due to the client for this build being a multi franchise dealer, nine separate sites were built for each franchise including a group site.

The group site acted as a general resource that would link out to all of the other sub sites. Each franchise sub site came with their own guidelines that required implementing to make sure they met each manufacturer's strict standards.

Custom features were built using JQuery and SASS to added extra UX to the site as well as custom built components using PHP and HTTP API calls to add each functionality detailed in the design brief.

Due to the amount of hits the site receives across all devices the responsive design of the site was focused on in great detail. Mobile devices were fast becoming the client's largest user sessions so mobile first approach was taken at the start of the build and built up to desktop.
